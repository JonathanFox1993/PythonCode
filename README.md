For research on these Exercises I mostly watched videos on youtube and learned how the syntax in python worked.

The best piece of learning for me was the actual python tutorial site

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

I found that it was the best website for straight forward information about the programming langauge.

Struggled the most with the 5th Euler problem but i think its mostly due to not having done basic math in so long and just using a calculator for everything
